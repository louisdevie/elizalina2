# Elizalina II

### What's this ?

An i18n tool I made to cope with the fact I still haven't found an internship.

### How do I use it ?

*That's the neat part, you don't !*

I strongly advise against using it in any real project as it's still in early development. Its only use right now is
dogfooding.
